# Question 25
# What is the expected behavior of the following code snippet?
# from random import randint
# for i in range(10):
#     print(random(1, 5))
# A. The program will generate a sequence of ten (pseudo)random integers from 1 to 5
# B. The program will generate a sequence of ten (pseudo)random integers from 1 to 4
# C. The program will generate a sequence of ten (pseudo)random numbers from 1 to 5
# D. The program will generate a sequence of ten (pseudo)random numbers from 1 to 4
# E. The result cannot be predicted
# F. The program will cause a runtime exception/errors
